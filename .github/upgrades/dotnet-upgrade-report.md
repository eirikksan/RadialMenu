## Project feature upgrades

Contains summary of modifications made to the project assets during different upgrade stages.

### RadialMenu\RadialMenu.csproj

Here is what changed for the project during upgrade:

- **Converted to SDK-style project format**: Migrated from legacy .NET Framework project format to modern SDK-style format, reducing project file complexity from 112 lines to 15 lines
- **Added multi-targeting support**: Set up support for both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.0 Windows to maintain backward compatibility while enabling modern .NET features
- **Removed AssemblyInfo.cs**: Assembly metadata is now handled by project properties in the modern format
- **Simplified references**: Removed verbose assembly references (Microsoft.CSharp, PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, System assemblies, etc.) as they are now implicitly included by the SDK
- **Enabled WPF support**: Added UseWPF property for .NET 8.0 Windows platform support

### RadialMenuDemo\RadialMenuDemo.csproj

Here is what changed for the project during upgrade:

- **Converted to SDK-style project format**: Migrated from legacy .NET Framework project format to modern SDK-style format
- **Added multi-targeting support**: Set up support for both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.0 Windows to maintain backward compatibility while enabling modern .NET features
- **Removed AssemblyInfo.cs**: Assembly metadata is now handled by project properties in the modern format  
- **Simplified references**: Removed unnecessary assembly references (Microsoft.CSharp, PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, System assemblies, etc.) as they are now implicitly included by the SDK

## Next steps

- **Test both target frameworks**: Build and test your application on both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.0 to ensure compatibility
- **Consider migration timeline**: Plan gradual migration of deployments from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 8.0 to take advantage of performance improvements and modern features
- **Update CI/CD pipelines**: Ensure your build and deployment pipelines support multi-targeting and can build for both frameworks
- **Review dependencies**: Check if any third-party packages have newer versions optimized for .NET 8.0
